To ensure the uniqueness of our brand as a student club. We are launching a new website. Forked from 2017's webpage (by @mitchazj), this website builds on react-vite. As vite is fast to set up and the packages are small. Using react allows future implementations to link to different sorts of cool APIs, and serverless functions. Hopefully, the use case is acceptable and the solution is not over-engineered garbage.

The website follows the 2023 style guide created by Drayko Medlyn and Shreya Arora's edit on the 2023 sponsorship prospectus. This website aims to improve the interactive experience by limiting relatively expensive user interaction. i.e. click (occupational disease prevention for developers and gamers), and scrolling (because who has time to read). Hence we are promoting a "peak and seek" interaction through effects like hover, animation and more. Attempt to gamify an information site, which seeks to inform.
